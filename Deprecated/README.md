### Previous Tests and Projects

This repository contains previous tests aiming to understand the SPI functionality, including some functional tests between ESP32 boards, Nordic boards, and tests between ESP32 and Nordic.

Most of these projects were discontinued, with the majority being removed due to functionality issues. However, some have been kept for future reference, as they might be revisited under a different approach, which is the active direction of this repository.

For any questions regarding the codes and functionalities of these projects, feel free to reach out to me via the following email addresses:
