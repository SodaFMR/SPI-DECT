### Given material for the project

This files were provided to help getting the work done. These codes were made before I got to work on the project. If you are looking for my previous tests, please check out the **Deprecated** directory, which can be found within this repository.

The materials include various I2C and SPI tests, as well as additional information and implementations related to the DECT approach. Although DECT is not within the scope of my current project, it may be useful for future developments.
